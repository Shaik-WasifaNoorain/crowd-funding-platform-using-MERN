# Getting Started with Crowdfunding Platform (Frontend)

This project is the **frontend** of a Crowdfunding Platform built using React. It provides an interactive and responsive user interface for managing and supporting crowdfunding campaigns.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

### `npm run eject`
**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, so you have full control over them.

At this point, you’re on your own!

You don’t have to use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when needed.
